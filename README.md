# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

The following additions were developed for beta testing in the PlanMyTrip App to improve on the available features.

a) A ***Customer Travel Destinations Map*** that displays a list of potential vacation lacations based on the user's input for desired weather.  

b) A ***Travel Itinerary Map*** based on four cities of the user's choice. With the use of Google Maps Directions API, the user will be able to view the travel route between the four cities as well the detailed location info markers. 

Both maps are equipped with detailed destination markers that provide the user with the following information:

- Hotel name
- City
- Country
- Current weather description with the maximum temperature (FÂ°)
