# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

The following additions were developed for beta testing in the PlanMyTrip App to improve on the available features.

1. A ***Customer Travel Destinations Map*** that displays a list of potential vacation lacations based on the user's input for desired weather.  

2. A ***Travel Itinerary Map*** based on four cities of the user's choice. With the use of Google Maps Directions API, the user will be able to view **a)** the travel route between the four cities and **b)** the detailed location info markers. 

Both maps are equipped with detailed destination markers that provide the user with the following information:

- Hotel name
- City
- Country
- Current weather description with the maximum temperature (FÂ°)
